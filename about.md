First of all, here's a **high five**

Next, check out some of my posts! Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! You'll never find out until you read them all! 

A little bit about the man you can't stop reading about:

I graduated college in May 2014 with Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released. Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on iOS development. This site helps me organize my thoughts around some cool iOS things (and most likely disorganize yours). Check out my posts or check the [Index](http://itshenry.com/Index.html) tab for a general overview of what I've been playing around with and some cool stuff!

Cheers!
