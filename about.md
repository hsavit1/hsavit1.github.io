First of all, here's a **high five** :raised_hand:

You might as well check out some of my posts. Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! Okay, I'll give you a primer first.

I have a love for stand up and I will shamelessly beat you in a golf game. I graduated college in May 2014 with dual Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released. 

Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on my startup, which means, getting familar with _all the technologies_ out there so I don't miss a beat. As you probably know, there's a wealth of information out there when it comes to getting started with a new software project, but the quality of most of it is unchecked and a good amount of it is near useless. I built this site to solve this problem - if you check out my posts or check the [Guides](http://itshenry.com/Index.html) tab, you will only find free, incredibly helpful, and useful things, as well as general overview of what I've been playing around with (and some cool stuff!). 

:beers: _Raises Glass_ :beers: 

Cheers to you
