First of all, here's a **high five**

You might as well check out some of my posts. Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! Here's a bit of a primer on the man you can't stop reading about

I have a love for stand up and I will shamelessly beat you in a golf game. I graduated college in May 2014 with dual Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released.

Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on my startup, which means, getting familar with _all the technologies_ that are out there so I don't miss a beat. This site helps me organize my thoughts around some cool software development things (and most likely disorganize yours). Check out my posts or check the [Index](http://itshenry.com/Index.html) tab for a general overview of what I've been playing around with / some cool stuff. Hopefully I point you in the right direction towards something rad

_Raises Glass_
Cheers to you
