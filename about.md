First of all, here's a **high five**

Next, check out some of my posts! Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! You'll never find out until you read them all! 

A little bit about the man you can't stop reading about:

I know way to much about New York Sports, I have a love for Stand Up Comedy, and I will beat you in a golf game. You can find me at the gym. I graduated college in May 2014 with dual Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released. Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on my startup, which means, getting familar with _all the technologies_ that are out there. This site helps me organize my thoughts around some cool software development things (and most likely disorganize yours). Check out my posts or check the [Index](http://itshenry.com/Index.html) tab for a general overview of what I've been playing around with and some cool stuff!

Cheers!
