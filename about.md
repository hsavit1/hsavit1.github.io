First of all, here's a **high five** :raised_hand:

You might as well check out some of my posts. Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! Okay, I'll give you a primer first.

About me personally: I'm not like most other programmers... I think Jon Stewart is the man and I will shamelessly kick your butt in a golf match. But I do think functional programming is awesome. I graduated college in May 2014 with dual Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released.

Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on my startup, which means, getting familar with all the latest technologies out there. I decided to not go for my masters in computer science right after undergrad, so I've had to do a lot of "figuring out" on my own. In the process I've come across a wealth of information out there but unfortunately the quality of most of it is unchecked and a good amount of it is really just unhelpful. I built this site to solve this problem - if you check out my posts or check the [Guides](http://itshenry.com/Index.html) tab, you will only find free, incredibly helpful, and useful things, as well as general sense of the technologies that I've been playing around with (plus some genuinely cool stuff). You're still going to have to read _a lot_ to really figure things out, but at least your reading list will be all in one place.

Anyway, thanks for reading

:beers: _Cheers to you_ :beers:
