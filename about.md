First of all, if you are checking out this page, here's a **high five**

Next, check out some of my posts! Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! You'll never find out until you read them all! (in all seriousness if you read ANY of these posts I'd be overjoyed)

A little bit about the man you can't stop reading about:

I graduated college in May 2014 with Bachelors in Math and Physics but quickly transitioned to a career as an iOS developer as soon as iOS 7 was released. Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on iOS development. This site helps me organize my thoughts around some cool iOS things (and most likely disorganize yours). Check out the index for a list of writings
