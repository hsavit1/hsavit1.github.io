First of all, if you are checking out this page, here's a **high five**

Next, check out some of my posts! Maybe you'll find something useful. Maybe not?! You'll never find out until you read them all! (in all seriousness if you read ANY of these posts I'd be overjoyed)

A little bit about the man you can't stop reading about:

I graduated from a top school with multiple science degrees and such... _yadda yadda yadda_. Nowadays I've focused most of my efforts on iOS development. This site helps me organize my thoughts around some cool iOS things and personal thoughts related to life as a coder in general (and most likely disorganize yours).


Thank you
