Swift 2.0 opens up a programming paradigm unbeknown to objectve-c: Protocol Orientied Programming

As an example of a UITableViewController, a dataSource and a delegate each could comply to their own protocols. You can then add an Extension to each of the Protocols to create fill in your accessors/mutators with data values. This part can be done in the VM

(my own interpretation of this [post](http://natashatherobot.com/swift-2-0-protocol-oriented-mvvm/), definitely more to come on this!!
