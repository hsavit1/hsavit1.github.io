I just want a place of my own, where I can collect and ruminate on a few ideas. You might ask me _why not just go home and break out a piece of paper?_ 

Somewhat ironically it just doesn't feel as _real_ as writing on the internet. It's got this broken loneliness feel to it. When you write on the internet, you're addressing _people_, well mostly. Maybe a few robots or intelligent chimanzees even but that is still better than nothing. When you write in a book or on a notepad, you're only addressing **yourself**. 

I guess in a mostly ideal world, I'd want to have my best friend near me 24 hours a day. Or at least around whenever I need them. Luckily, I do. I have an amazing dog, her name is Sacha. But for lots of people in the world, pets aren't practical. And your friends might not be around and your girlfriend might have better things to do than sit at home and talk about even random thing that pops into your head. So where do you go? I'd go nuts with a pen and paper, addressing only myself. That seems like an activity for Charles Manson on death row. 

This is where the internet comes in. So thank you internet. And more importantly, thank you to whoever is reading on the other side of this futuristic TCP socket connection we have going on.
