Swift is awesome when it comes to design patterns. Well at least compared to Objective-C- that is, when it comes to visibility 

Recently, I've read the Apress book _Pro Design Patterns in Swift_, which had a much bigger impact on me than the other Apress book _Pro Design Patterns in Objective-C_. This github [post](https://github.com/ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift) is also an awesome introduction to design patterns, and of course there is this Ray Wenderlich [post](http://www.raywenderlich.com/86053/intermediate-design-patterns-in-swift) 

Here's my attempt to break down all of these design patterns

#Creation Patterns
1. **Object Template Pattern**
2. **Prototype Pattern**
3. **Singleton Pattern**
4. **Object Pool Pattern**
5. **Factory Method Pattern**
6. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
7. **Builder Pattern**

#Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter Pattern**
2. **Bridge Pattern**
3. **Dectorator Pattern**
4. **Composite Pattern**
5. **Facade Pattern**
6. **Flyweight Pattern**
7. **Proxy Pattern**

#Behavioral Patterns
1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
2. **Command Pattern**
3. **Mediator Pattern**
4. **Observer Pattern**
5. **Memento Pattern**
6. **Strategy Pattern**
7. **Visitor Pattern**
8. **Template Method Pattern**
9. **Interpreter Pattern**
10. **Iterator Pattern**
11. **State Pattern**
12. **Servant Pattern**
