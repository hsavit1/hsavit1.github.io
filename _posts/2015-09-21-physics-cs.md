As someone who graduated with dual bachelors degrees in Math and Physics, I am pretty opinionated on the subject of "why did you study that?" In truth, this is quite a difficult question to answer. Mostly because, to break down most of the concepts to an uniterested computer scientist is usually a daunting task. In college I had the opportunity to TA for an entry level calculus based physics class and I quickly realized that most computer scientists were unwilling to listen to any of the passionate goodness that poured out of me. This leads me to...

Problem #1: **Many computer scientists and engineers lack a deeper sense of appreciation**. Some may argue that this is just a product of my students lack of life experience. That is obviously true to an extent. Or even just a massive generalization of the practice of engieering as a whole. Regardless, it's worth writing about because I believe the problems are more deeply rooted than that.
