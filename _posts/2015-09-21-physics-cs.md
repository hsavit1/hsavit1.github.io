As someone who graduated with dual bachelors degrees in Math and Physics from Binghamton University, I get pretty opinionated by questions that go like this: "why the hell would you study that?" In truth, this is not even close to an easy question to answer. Mostly because, to break down most of the concepts to an uniterested and possibly hungover programmer is usually pretty damn excruciating. Most of the time, you the hacker don't even care to hear me out. But you should, because physics is a beautiful and  extraordinary subject 

> Let me tell you why you should listen

In college I had the opportunity to TA for an entry level calculus based physics class and I quickly realized that most computer scientists were mostly dismissive of most of the passionate goodness that poured out of me. This leads me to...

> Problem #1: Most computer scientists and engineers lack a deeper sense of appreciation, which is kind of depressing

Some may argue that this is just a product of my students lack of life experience or even just a massive sweeping generalization of the practice of engieering as a whole. That is obviously true to an extent. Most of my students were age 20 or younger and they were all engineers, not scientists. Regardless the issue I am addressing is still worth writing about because I still have no reason to believe that programmers have suddenly "figured it out" as they move out of college and into industry.

_More on this to come when I have time for a good rant..._
